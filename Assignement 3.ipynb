    " Question and answer\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
    " A function is an independent block of code that is not associated with any specific object or class.\n",
    "It can be defined and called from anywhere in your program.\n",
    "Functions typically operate on data passed to them as arguments and can return a value.\n",
    "Exxxample-def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "]    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "result = add_numbers(5, 3)\n",
    "print(f\"The sum is: {result}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: \n",
    "\n",
    "    A method is a function that is associated with an object or a class.\n",
    "    It is defined within a class and is called on an instance of that class (an object).\n",
    "    Methods implicitly receive the object they are called upon as their first argument, conventionally named self. This allows methods to access and modify the object's attributes (data) and perform actions specific to that object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a Method:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.breed = breed\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
    "my_dog.bark() # Calling the bark method on the my_dog object\n",
    "\n",
    "      \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "Parameters are the variables defined within the parentheses of a function's definition. They act as placeholders for the values that the function expects to receive when it is called. Parameters specify the types and number of inputs a function can accept.\n",
    "Consider the following function definition:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "def greet(name, age):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, name and age are the parameters of the greet function.\n",
    "Arguments:\n",
    "Arguments are the actual values or data that are passed to a function when it is called. These values are assigned to the corresponding parameters within the function's scope during execution. \n",
    "Using the greet function example:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
    "    Using the def keyword: This is the most common way to define a function. \n",
    "        def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The return statement in a Python function serves two primary purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Exiting the Function:\n",
    "    When a return statement is encountered within a function, the function's execution immediately terminates. Any code following the return statement within that function will not be executed. Control is then passed back to the point in the code where the function was called.\n",
    "    Returning a Value:\n",
    "    The return statement can optionally be followed by an expression or a value. This value is then \"returned\" to the caller of the function. This allows the function to produce a result that can be used by other parts of the program. If no value or expression is specified after return, or if the function reaches its end without encountering a return statement, it implicitly returns None. \n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    # The function returns the sum of a and b\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "# The returned value (8) is stored in the `result` variable\n",
    "result = add_numbers(5, 3)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterables:\n",
    "An iterable is any object in Python that can be iterated over, meaning you can loop through its elements one by one. Common examples include lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
    "To be an iterable, an object must implement the __iter__() method, which returns an iterator.\n",
    "Iterators:\n",
    "An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data and allows you to traverse through the elements of an iterable one at a time.\n",
    "An iterator must implement two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "    __iter__(): Returns the iterator object itself.\n",
    "    __next__(): Returns the next item from the sequence. When there are no more items, it raises \n",
    "a StopIteration exception. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
    " Generators in Python are a type of iterable, similar to lists or tuples, but with a key difference: they produce values on the fly, one at a time, instead of storing all values in memory simultaneously. This makes them highly memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets or potentially infinite sequences. \n",
    "    def count_up_to(n):\n",
    "        i = 1\n",
    "        while i <= n:\n",
    "            yield i\n",
    "            i += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Using the generator function\n",
    "    my_generator = count_up_to(5)\n",
    "    for number in my_generator:\n",
    "        print(number)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
    "Generators offer significant advantages over regular functions for tasks involving\n",
    "large datasets, memory efficiency, and creating data streams. Unlike regular functions that execute entirely and store all results in memory, generators yield values one at a time, pausing their execution and resuming when the next value is requested. \n",
    "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
    " A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Unlike standard functions defined with def, lambda functions do not require a name and are typically limited to a single expression, which is implicitly returned. \n",
    "lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The map() function in Python serves the purpose of applying a specified function to each item in an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or set) and returning an iterator that yields the results. It provides a concise and efficient way to perform transformations on data within iterables.\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Apply the 'square' function to each number in the 'numbers' list\n",
    "squared_numbers_map = map(square, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert the map object to a list to view the results\n",
    "squared_numbers_list = list(squared_numbers_map)\n",
    "print(squared_numbers_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using map with a lambda function\n",
    "celsius_temps = [0, 20, 37, 100]\n",
    "fahrenheit_temps_map = map(lambda c: (c * 9/5) + 32, celsius_temps)\n",
    "fahrenheit_temps_list = list(fahrenheit_temps_map)\n",
    "print(fahrenheit_temps_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python are all higher-order functions that operate on iterables, but they serve distinct purposes:\n",
    "1. map():\n",
    "\n",
    "    Purpose: Applies a given function to each item in an iterable (or multiple iterables) and returns an iterator that yields the results. It transforms each element individually.\n",
    "    Output: An iterator containing the transformed elements, with the same number of elements as the input iterable(s).\n",
    "    Example: Converting a list of numbers to their squares. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "    squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x*x, numbers))\n",
    "    # squared_numbers will be [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. filter():\n",
    "\n",
    "    Purpose: Constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. It selectively keeps elements based on a condition.\n",
    "    Output: An iterator containing only the elements that satisfy the given condition. The number of elements can be less than or equal to the input iterable.\n",
    "    Example: Filtering out even numbers from a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "    even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n",
    "    # even_numbers will be [2, 4, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. reduce():\n",
    "\n",
    "    Purpose: Applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value. It combines elements to produce a single result.\n",
    "    Output: A single value resulting from the cumulative application of the function.\n",
    "    Note: reduce() is not a built-in function in Python 3; it needs to be imported from the functools module.\n",
    "    Example: Calculating the sum of all numbers in a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "(Attach paper image for this answer) in doc or colab notebook.\n",
    "11. Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using reduce function on this given\n",
    "list:[47,11,42,13];\n",
    "The sum operation with reduce works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    reduce is called with a function that adds two numbers, and a list of numbers.\n",
    "    It takes the first two numbers from the list and applies the function to them.\n",
    "    The result of that operation becomes the new accumulator for the next step.\n",
    "    It then takes that accumulated value and the next number in the list and applies the function again.\n",
    "    This continues until all elements in the list have been processed, and the final accumulated value is returned. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation of the sum operation\n",
    "1. Initial state\n",
    "\n",
    "    List: [47, 11, 42, 13]\n",
    "    Initial accumulator value: 47 (the first element of the list, as no initial value is provided)\n",
    "    First currentValue: 11 (the second element) \n",
    "\n",
    "2. First iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "    Operation: 47 + 11\n",
    "    Result: 58\n",

    "    currentValue: 42\n",
    "    Operation: 58 + 42\n",
    "    Result: 100\n",
    "    Internal State: The new accumulator becomes 100.\n",

    "    Result: 113\n",
    "    Internal State: The new accumulator becomes 113.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Final result\n",
    "\n",
    "    The list is now empty of unprocessed items.\n",
    "    The reduce function returns the final accumulated value, which is 113\n",
