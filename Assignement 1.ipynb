    "Question and answer\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
    "paython is interpreter languange and high level programmin g language It is known for the language simplicity\n",
    "as well as easy to use it has inbuilt library functionality which is easy to use and its open platform so anyone can easily \n",
    "access it and used it is platform indepedent also so its quite profitable for large as well as small based company.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.An interpreter is a program that directly executes code. \n",
    "For Python, it's the software that takes your written Python code and runs it. Instead of translating the entire program into machine code all at once (like a compiler), a Python interpreter reads and executes the code line by line. What is an interpreter in Python.\n",
    "when you run paython interperform this steps lexical analysis and parsing , bytecode compliation and executed by PVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.what are predefined keywords in paython ?\n",
    "predefined keywords:\n",
    "True, False, None: Boolean values and a null value.\n",
    "\n",
    "and, or, not: Logical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "if, elif, else: Conditional statements for controlling program flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "for, while, break, continue: Loops and loop control.\n",
    "\n",
    "def: Used to define a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "class: Used to define a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "import, from: Used to import modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "try, except, finally: Used for error and exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
    "No keywords can not be used as variable names in paython \n",
    "\n",
    "5.   What is mutability in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable objects can be altered in place without creating a new object. When you modify a mutable object, its unique identity (memory address) remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of mutable data types include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    list: You can add, remove, or change elements within a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "dict: You can add, remove, or modify key-value pairs in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "set: You can add or remove elements from a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable \n",
    "The key difference between lists and tuples in Python is a design choice related to their intended use and underlying implementation. \n",
    "Lists are designed to be dynamic and flexible, while tuples are designed for immutability and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python \n",
    "The == operator compares the values of two objects. It returns True if the objects have the same content, regardless of whether they are stored at the \n",
    "same memory location. This is what you typically use to check if two variables have the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.what is the logical operator in paython?\n",
    "paython has three logical operator and or and not \n",
    "\n",
    "9.what is the type casting in paython?\n",
    "Python provides several built-in functions to perform type casting. \n",
    "These functions don't change the original variable; instead, they return a new object of the desired type.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n",
    "In programming, type casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. The difference between implicit and explicit type casting lies in whether the conversion is performed automatically by the compiler or manually by the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.  What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python \n",
    "Conditional statements evaluate a boolean expression (an expression that results in either True or False). If the expression is true, the code block indented under the statement is executed. If it's false, that block is skipped, and the program either moves to the next elif (else if) or else statement, or continues with the rest of the code.\n",
    "The main types of conditional statements in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    if statement: Executes a block of code only if the condition is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "    elif statement: An optional part of an if statement, it checks for another condition if the previous if or elif statements were all False.\n",
    "\n",
    "    else statement: An optional part of an if statement, it executes a block of code if all preceding if and elif conditions were False.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12.  How does the elif statement work \n",
    "The elif statement in Python, short for \"else if,\" is used to check multiple conditions \n",
    "sequentially after an initial if statement. It's a way to handle multiple outcomes in a single conditional block.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is the difference between for and while loops\n",
    "The primary difference between for and while loops is how they determine when to stop. A for loop is used for iterating a known number of times, typically over a sequence \n",
    "(like a list or string), while a while loop is used for iterating as long as a certain condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
    "A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when you don't know in advance how many times the loop needs to run. The loop's \n",
    "termination depends on a condition being met, rather than on iterating through a fixed sequence.\n",
